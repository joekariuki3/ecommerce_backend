# E-commerce Backend

## 1. Project Requirements

This section outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the e-commerce product catalog backend system.

### Functional Requirements

These define _what_ the system must do.

**Product & Category Management** üõçÔ∏è

- **Admin Role:** Admins must have full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for products and categories.

**User Management & Authentication** üîí

- **User Accounts:** The system must support user registration and login.
- **JWT Authentication:** All protected API endpoints must be secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Profile Management:** Authenticated users must be able to view and update their own profile information.

**Product Discovery** üîç

- **Filtering:** Users must be able to filter the product list by **category**.
- **Sorting:** Users must be able to sort products by **price** (required). The system should also be designed to allow sorting by **name** and **date added**.
- **Pagination:** API endpoints that return a list of products must paginate the results to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Search:** The system should include a basic search functionality to find products by **name**.

**User Roles & Permissions** üë•

- **Admin:** Full control over product and category data.
- **Authenticated User (Shopper):** Can manage their profile, view products, and perform shopping-related actions (details to be defined).
- **Unauthenticated User (Guest):** Can only browse/view products.

**API Documentation** üìÑ

- The system must have auto-generated, interactive API documentation using **Swagger/OpenAPI**.
- This documentation must be hosted and publicly accessible for frontend developers.

### Non-Functional Requirements

These define _how_ the system should operate.

**Technology Stack** üíª

- **Backend Framework:** Django
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication Mechanism:** JWT
- **Testing Framework:** Pytest

**Performance** ‚ö°

- **Database Optimization:** The database schema must be designed for high performance, utilizing **indexing** on frequently queried columns (e.g., product price, category foreign key).

**Code Quality & Maintainability** ‚ú®

- The codebase must be clean, well-documented, and easily maintainable.
- The project repository must have a logical and well-organized structure.

**Security** üõ°Ô∏è

- User authentication must be implemented securely, following best practices for JWT handling (e.g., token expiration, secure storage).

**DevOps & CI/CD** üöÄ

- **Version Control:** Git must be used, with a commit message convention (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
- **Environments:** The project must support three distinct environments: **testing**, **staging**, and **production**.
- **Configuration:** Environment variables must be managed using `.env` files for local development and **GitHub Secrets** for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** A GitHub Actions workflow must be triggered on every push to:
  1.  Run the test suite using **Pytest**.
  2.  Build a **Docker image** of the application.
  3.  Push the Docker image to **Docker Hub**.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
  1.  Upon successful CI, the application will be automatically deployed to the **staging** environment.
  2.  A mechanism will be in place to deploy from staging to the **production** environment.

## 2\. Database Design

### Entities and Relationships

Based on the project requirements, we can identify three primary entities: **User**, **Category**, and **Product**.

- **User**: Represents an individual interacting with the system. Django's built-in `User` model is a perfect fit, providing fields for username, email, password, and roles/permissions (`is_staff` for admins).
- **Category**: Represents a classification for products (e.g., "Electronics," "Books").
- **Product**: Represents an item available for sale.

The key relationship is between `Product` and `Category`:

- A **Category** can have many **Products**.
- A **Product** belongs to exactly **one Category**.
- This defines a **one-to-many** relationship.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Here is an ERD in Mermaid.js format, which will render directly in a GitHub Wiki. It visualizes the entities, their key attributes, and the relationship between them.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    "USER" {
        int id PK
        varchar username UK
        varchar email UK
        varchar password_hash
        bool is_staff "Admin role"
        datetime date_joined
    }

    "CATEGORY" {
        int id PK
        varchar name UK "Unique category name"
        text description
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }

    "PRODUCT" {
        int id PK
        varchar name
        text description
        decimal price
        int stock_quantity
        int category_id FK "Links to CATEGORY"
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }

    "CATEGORY" ||--o{ "PRODUCT" : "has"

```

\*\*

### Database Schema (3NF)

The following SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements represent the proposed database schema. This design is in **Third Normal Form (3NF)** because:

1.  It meets 1NF (all values are atomic) and 2NF (no partial dependencies on a composite key).
2.  It meets 3NF by eliminating transitive dependencies. For example, a product's category name is not stored in the `products` table; instead, we store a `category_id` foreign key, ensuring that non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
-- Represents users, leveraging Django's built-in auth model.
-- This is a simplified representation.
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(254) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    is_staff BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE, -- Determines admin status
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    date_joined TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Represents product categories
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Represents products
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    stock_quantity INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    category_id INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    CONSTRAINT fk_category
        FOREIGN KEY(category_id)
        REFERENCES categories(id)
        ON DELETE RESTRICT -- Prevents deleting a category if products are linked to it
);
```

### Performance & Indexing Considerations

To ensure fast query performance for filtering, sorting, and searching, the following indexes are recommended:

- **`products.category_id`**: An index should be created on this foreign key. This is critical for speeding up filtering products by category. Django automatically creates this index for `ForeignKey` fields.
- **`products.price`**: An index on this column is essential for efficient sorting by price.
- **`products.name`**: To support the "search by name" feature, an index on the `name` column will significantly improve the performance of `LIKE` or full-text search queries.
- **`categories.name`**: The `UNIQUE` constraint on this column will automatically create an index, ensuring fast lookups by category name.

## 3. System Actors and User Roles

This section defines the different types of users (actors) who will interact with the e-commerce backend and outlines their specific roles and permissions.

### 1. Administrator (Admin)

- **Description**: The **Administrator** is a superuser with full control over the system's data. This role is intended for internal staff responsible for managing the product catalog and overall system health. In Django, this user will have the `is_staff` flag set to `True`.
- **Interactions & Permissions**:
  - **Product Management**: Can **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** any product in the system.
  - **Category Management**: Can **CRUD** any product category.
  - **User Oversight**: Can view a list of all users (though not typically responsible for day-to-day user management in this scope).

### 2. Authenticated User (Shopper)

- **Description**: An **Authenticated User** is anyone who has successfully registered and logged into the system. They are the primary consumers of the e-commerce platform.
- **Interactions & Permissions**:
  - **Product Discovery**: Can **view** (Read) lists of products and individual product details.
  - **Filtering & Sorting**: Can use all available **filtering** (by category) and **sorting** (by price, name, date) functionalities.
  - **Search**: Can **search** for products by name.
  - **Profile Management**: Can **view and update** their own user profile information (e.g., change their password, update their email).
  - **Authentication**: Can **log in** to gain access to their account and **log out** to end their session.

### 3. Unauthenticated User (Guest)

- **Description**: An **Unauthenticated User** is any visitor who has not logged into the system. Their access is limited to browsing the public-facing product catalog.
- **Interactions & Permissions**:
  - **Product Discovery**: Can **view** (Read) lists of products and individual product details.
  - **Filtering & Sorting**: Can use all available **filtering** and **sorting** functionalities.
  - **Search**: Can **search** for products by name.
  - **Restricted Access**: **Cannot** access any authenticated routes, such as a user profile page. They must register or log in to proceed with actions like making a purchase (which is outside the current scope but an implied next step).

## 5\. Project Structure and Development Plan

### High-Level Architecture

The system will be a **modular monolithic API**. We will use Django and the Django REST Framework (DRF) to build a backend service that exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints. The architecture will be organized into distinct Django "apps," where each app is responsible for a specific domain of functionality.

- **Core App**: Will handle project-wide settings, configurations for different environments (development, staging, production), and root URL routing.
- **Users App**: Responsible for all user-related logic, including registration, JWT-based authentication, and profile management.
- **Catalog App**: Manages all product and category data, including models, serializers, and the API views for CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, and pagination.

### Proposed Project Structure

Here is a recommended directory structure for the Django project. This layout promotes separation of concerns and scalability.
